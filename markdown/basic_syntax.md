# Headers  
Headers start with number sign(#). Header number is determined by the number of sign.  
\#\# is a heading 2.  

> use \\ to escape a markdown character.  


# Bold  

> Enclose characters in double asterisks(\*\*) and should not have space in between. Underscore can be used as alternative but asterisk is the recommended approach.  


# Italic  

> Use single asterisk(\*) to italicize word, no space in between.  
> Use three(3) asterisks(\*) to bold and italicize characters at the same time.  


# Blockquotes  

> Use \> to create a blockquote.  

> For blockquotes with multiple paragraphs, insert a blank line in between with symbol \> at the beginning.  

> For nested blockquotes, add another \> to mark indention (i.e. \>\> for single indent)  

> Blockquotes with other elements - insert the \> symbol first then add space then add the element symbol (i.e. \> \- sample content here)  


# Ordered Lists  

> Use number 1.(dot included) to indicate the start of an ordered lists. The succeeding numbers doesn't matter.  

> For nested ordered lists, add a tab before each line of indented section.
