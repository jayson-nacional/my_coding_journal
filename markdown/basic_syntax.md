# Headers  

Headers start with number sign(#). Header number is determined by the number of sign.  
\#\# is a heading 2.  

> use \\ to escape a markdown character.  
>
> always add a blank line before and after the header.


# Bold  

> Enclose characters in double asterisks(\*\*) and should not have space in between. Underscore can be used as alternative but asterisk is the recommended approach.  


# Italic  

> Use single asterisk(\*) to italicize word, no space in between.  
> Use three(3) asterisks(\*) to bold and italicize characters at the same time.  


# Blockquotes  

> Use \> to create a blockquote.  
>
> For blockquotes with multiple paragraphs, insert a blank line in between with symbol \> at the beginning.  
>
> For nested blockquotes, add another \> to mark indention (i.e. \>\> for single indent)  
>
> Blockquotes with other elements - insert the \> symbol first then add space then add the element symbol (i.e. \> \- sample content here)  


# Ordered Lists  

> Use number 1.(dot included) to indicate the start of an ordered lists. The succeeding numbers doesn't matter.  
>
> For nested ordered lists, add a tab before each line of indented section.  


# Unordered Lists  

> Use dashes(\-), asterisks(\*) or plus(\+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.  
>
> If starting unordered lists with a number and period, make sure to escape the period with a backward slash(\\).  
>
> Don't mix and match the symbols, if using a dash for the first line then do so for the remaining lines.  
>
> When adding an element inside a list, add an indent equal to a single tab or four(4) spaces.  
>
> For code blocks indent using two(2) tabs or eight(8) spaces  


# Code Blocks  

> To create code blocks, enclose the text in backticks(')
>
> Sample: ``Use `code` in your Markdown file.``
>
> Sample codeblock inside a blockquote  
```
    <html>  
        <head>  
        </head>  
    </html>  
```  


# Horizontal Rules  

> Use three(3) or more asterisks(\*), dashes(-) or undersores(_)
>
> -------
>
> Always add a blank line before and after the horizontal rule.  


# Links  

> To create links enclose the text in brackets (i.e. [test link]) and put the url inside a parenthesis.  
>
> To add a title, put the title after the url, enclosed in double quotes. Will appear as popup when hovered.    
>
> Sample [github](https://github.com/jayson-nacional/my_coding_journal/blob/main/markdown/basic_syntax.md "Basic syntax")
>
> To make a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets. (\<\>)
>
> Formatting links -> just simply add the correct formatting symbol before and after the link block/element.  
>
> **TODO**: learn about reference-style links, link best practices  


# Images  

> Add ! followed by the alt text in brackers and parenthesis to enclose the image url and title  
>
> To link an image, enclose the image block inside the first bracket block of the link
