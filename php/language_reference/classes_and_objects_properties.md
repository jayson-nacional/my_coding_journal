# Properties  

`$this` is the value of the calling object  

`readonly` properties prevent modification after initialization  

**Dyamic Properties** - If trying to assign to a non-existent property on an object, PHP will automatically create a corresponding property. This dynamically created property can only be accessible on the class instance.

Also known as "property accessors"
