# Composer  

Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.  

Is not a package manager but a dependencies manager. It is inspired by nodes npm and ruby's bundler  

**Suppose**  

1. You have a project that depends on a number of libraries
2. Some of those libraries depends on other libraries


**Composer**
1. Enables you to declare the libraries you depend on.
2. Finds out which versions of which packages can and need to be installed, and installs them (meaning it downloads them into your project)
3. You can update all your dependencies in one command
