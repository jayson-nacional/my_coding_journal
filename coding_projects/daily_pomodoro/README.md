# Daily Pomorodo  

**Pomodoro** - is a time management method that uses a timer break into intervals, typically 25 minutes long, separated by short breaks. Each work interval is called a `pomodoro`. After four(4) pomodoros, a longer break is taken.  

## Steps  
1. Pick a task
2. Set a 25-minute timer
3. Work on your task until the task is done 
4. Take 5 minute break
5. Every four(4) pomodoros take a longer 15-30 minute break  


## WHAT?  

The aim of this project is to create a simple to do app integrated with Pomodoro principles. Common feature that this app aims to include are:  
1. Daily ToDo (ability to create small tasks aimed to be completed on a daily basis)
2. Add a timer functionality to the task items where only one timer should run at a given time (defaults to 25 minutes)
3. Ability to group tasks (in case of larger/complex goals, splitting them into small pomodoro blocks is ideal, but grouping them to the main task is helpful to identify the progress of each goal)
4. Implement login functionality to manage user entries  


## HOW?  

This project will be fully implemented in PHP and MySQL, although the idea of integrating JavaScript for more robust experience is planned for the future. For HTML styling, vanilla CSS will be used, although plans to utilize CSS frameworks like bootstrap is being considered in the future.


## WHERE?  

This will be hosted on a virtual machine running on ubuntu. NGINX with PHP-FPM is the preferred deployment setup. Setting up a pipeline is a goal but not a primary requirement on the early release.
